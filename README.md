# Toggle Sprint for Amethyst  
This mod allows you to press the sprint key once to sprint whenever you start moving forwards. You can press it again to stop sprinting.

## Why should I install this mod if I can just add W to Sprint in the `options.txt`?
1. W is removed from Sprint every time you rebind a control
2. You aren't able to stop sprinting with this method

## Usage Guide
1. Install [Amethyst Launcher](https://github.com/FrederoxDev/Amethyst-Launcher)
2. Open the Mod Manager in Amethyst Launcher, and click `Open Mods Folder`
3. Download the latest [Toggle-Sprint release](https://github.com/KingRocco21/ToggleSprint-Amethyst/releases) and the required AmethystRuntime
4. Add AmethystRuntime and Toggle-Sprint to the mods folder
5. Extract them, and check for duplicate folders inside each mod. If you see duplicate folder names, move the contents out of the duplicate.
6. Close and reopen Amethyst Launcher, open the `Profile Editor`, and create or edit a profile with AmethystRuntime and Toggle-Sprint enabled
7. Launch the game, and sprint should be toggled on by default.

## How do I change the sprint toggle keybind?
The keybind should be near the bottom of the `Keyboard & Mouse` settings. If it isn't, check to make sure you have the mod enabled in Amethyst Launcher.
