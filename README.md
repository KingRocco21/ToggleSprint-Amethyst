# Toggle Sprint for Amethyst  
This mod allows you to press the sprint key once to sprint whenever you start moving forwards. You can press it again to stop sprinting.

## Why should I install this mod if I can just add W to Sprint in the `options.txt`?
1. W is removed from Sprint every time you rebind a control
2. You aren't able to stop sprinting with this method

## Usage Guide
1. Install [Amethyst Launcher](https://github.com/FrederoxDev/Amethyst-Launcher)
2. Open the <img src="https://github.com/FrederoxDev/Amethyst-Launcher/blob/main/public/images/icons/bookshelf-icon.png?raw=true" width="24"> Mod Discovery page in the launcher
3. Search for `Toggle-Sprint` and click on it
4. Click on Versions
5. Install the latest release.

Alternatively, you can download the latest [Toggle-Sprint release](https://github.com/KingRocco21/ToggleSprint-Amethyst/releases) from GitHub and [install it manually](https://github.com/FrederoxDev/Amethyst-Launcher?tab=readme-ov-file#mods--runtimes).

## How do I change the sprint toggle keybind?
The keybind should be near the bottom of the `Keyboard & Mouse` settings. If it isn't, check to make sure you have the mod enabled in Amethyst Launcher.
